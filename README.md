## Why?

In short, the story goes like....

Groups were segregated and were no longer active. Groups lost charm. As everything moved online, we couldn't ask seniors for our doubts as we didn't know on which domain they were working on. We couldn't explore in our clubs and make new friends as nobody knew nobody (we just entered college and just after that - college was shut down). As I developed this through, one thing that often came to my mind was "I can add this, I can add that". So having this flexibility of developing any feature I wanted to have was fascinating. Just wanted to bring all the people under one roof. Masters or MBA or Desigining or Startup or any cool project or CP or anything. Just under one roof.
